# Backend

This directory contains the backend, built with Node.js and Express.js.

- **created the directory**: Created `backend/`
- **initialize project**: Ran `npm init -y` to create `package.json`
- **installed dependencies**: Ran `npm install express` to add Express.js for building the API server. This also created `node_modules/` and `package-lock.json`.
- **src dir**: Created an empty `src/` directory for source code

To run: `cd backend && npm start` (once scripts are added).
